# Rotary-Linear-Servo-Control-System
A MATLAB/Simulink control system that synchronizes a motor-driven linear cart with a rotating four-slit wheel. The system models servo motor dynamics, derives the rotary-to-linear kinematic mapping, and uses a PID + feedforward controller to achieve sub-percent timing accuracy.
